### LDAP authentication plugin for phpList

This repository contains an LDAP authentication plugin for phpList.
It is initialy based on an old patch for phplist_auth.inc submitted by bpeabody on [phplist Mantis](https://mantis.phplist.org/view.php?id=9816).
And reworked to fit the new approach introduced in v3.2.7 as described in [phplist documentation](https://resources.phplist.com/develop/authentication_plugin).
